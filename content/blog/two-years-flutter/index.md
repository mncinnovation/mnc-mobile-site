## What is Flutter

Flutter is an open source framework by Google for building beautiful, natively compiled, multi-platform applications from **a single codebase**. flutter UI use Declarative style, so developers just specifies **what is to be done** rather than how to do it.

#### Feature Gap

What is feature gap, its different feature between android and ios, some feature are available in android but ios. Since flutter are multiplatform there is **0 Feature gap**. Same experience, same launch time, same developer, more productive.
